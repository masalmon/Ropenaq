\usage{
aq_locations(
  country = NULL,
  city = NULL,
  location = NULL,
  parameter = NULL,
  has_geo = NULL,
  limit = 10000,
  latitude = NULL,
  longitude = NULL,
  radius = NULL,
  page = NULL
  siteType = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{country}{Limit results by a certain country -- a two-letters code see countries() for finding code based on name.}

\item{city}{Limit results by a certain city.}

\item{location}{Limit results by a certain location.}

\item{parameter}{Limit to only a certain parameter (valid values are 'pm25', 'pm10', 'so2', 'no2', 'o3', 'co' and 'bc').
If no parameter is given, all parameters are retrieved.}

\item{has_geo}{Filter out items that have or do not have geographic information.}

\item{limit}{Change the number of results returned, max is 10000 by page.
If no \code{page} value, then all results or \code{limit} * 100 (maximal number of pages)
is returned.}

\item{latitude}{Latitude of the center point (lat, lon) used to get measurements within a certain area.}

\item{longitude}{Longitude of the center point (lat, lon) used to get measurements within a certain area.}

\item{radius}{Radius (in meters) used to get measurements within a certain area, must be used with latitude and longitude}

\item{page}{The page of the results to query (max 100).}
}
\value{
A results data.frame (dplyr "tbl_df") with 12 columns:
\itemize{
\item the name of the location ("location"),
\item the city it is in ("city"),
\item the code of country it is in ("country"),
\item the name of the source of the information ("sourceName"),
\item the number of measures for this location in the platform ("count"),
\item the last time and date at which measures were updated for this location ("lastUpdated"),
\item the first time and date at which measures were updated for this location ("firstUpdated"),
\item the parameters available for this location ("parameters"),
\item its longitude ("longitude") and latitude if available ("latitude"),
\item and finally an URL encoded version of the city name ("cityURL")
\item and of the location name ("locationURL").
}
and two attributes, a meta data.frame (dplyr "tbl_df") with 1 line and 5 columns:
\itemize{
\item the API name ("name"),
\item the license of the data ("license"),
\item the website url ("website"),
\item the queried page ("page"),
\item the limit on the number of results ("limit"),
\item the number of results found on the platform for the query ("found")
}
and a timestamp data.frame (dplyr "tbl_df") with the query time and the last time at which the data was modified on the platform.
}
\description{
Providing data about distinct measurement locations.
}
\details{
For queries involving a city or location argument,
the URL-encoded name of the city/location (as in cityURL/locationURL),
not its name, should be used.
You can query any nested combination of country/location/city (level 1, 2 and 3),
with only one value for each argument.
If you write inconsistent combination such as city="Paris" and country="IN", an error message will be returned.
If you write city="Delhi", you do not need to write the code of the country, unless
one day there is a city with the same name in another country.
